     * Adjusts the specified temporal object.
     * <p>
     * This adjusts the specified temporal object using the logic
     * encapsulated in the implementing class.
     * Examples might be an adjuster that sets the date avoiding weekends, or one that
     * sets the date to the last day of the month.
     * <p>
     * There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
     * The first is to invoke this method directly.
     * The second is to use {@link Temporal#with(TemporalAdjuster)}:
     * <pre>
     *   // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
     *   temporal = thisAdjuster.adjustInto(temporal);
     *   temporal = temporal.with(thisAdjuster);
     * </pre>
     * It is recommended to use the second approach, {@code with(TemporalAdjuster)},
     * as it is a lot clearer to read in code.
     *
     * @param temporal the temporal object to adjust, not null
     * @return an object of the same observable type with the adjustment made, not null
     * @throws DateTimeException   if unable to make the adjustment
     * @throws ArithmeticException if numeric overflow occurs
     * @implSpec The implementation must take the input object and adjust it.
     * The implementation defines the logic of the adjustment and is responsible for
     * documenting that logic. It may use any method on {@code Temporal} to
     * query the temporal object and perform the adjustment.
     * The returned object must have the same observable type as the input object
     * <p>
     * The input object must not be altered.
     * Instead, an adjusted copy of the original must be returned.
     * This provides equivalent, safe behavior for immutable and mutable temporal objects.
     * <p>
     * The input temporal object may be in a calendar system other than ISO.
     * Implementations may choose to document compatibility with other calendar systems,
     * or reject non-ISO temporal objects by {@link TemporalQueries#chronology() querying the chronology}.
     * <p>
     * This method may be called from multiple threads in parallel.
     * It must be thread-safe when invoked.
