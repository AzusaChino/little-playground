 Already implemented via statistics.mean. statistics.mean takes an array as an argument whereas this function takes variadic arguments.

Returns the average of two or more numbers.

Takes the sum of all the args and divides it by len(args). The second argument 0.0 in sum is to handle floating point division in python3.
